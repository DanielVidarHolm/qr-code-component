## My process
---

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### Challenges

The image was behaving oddly and wasn't filling the container, I fixed it by displaying the image as a block and Hide the overflow

```css
.image-container {
    width:100%;
    border-radius:10px;
    overflow:hidden;
}
  .image-container > img{
          width:100%;
          display:block;
      }
```

### Optimizations

Better naming on css styles

### Continued development

In the future i would like to add a button that generates a QR Code based on what url you input.


### Useful resources

- [Css Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - This helped me for flexbox layoting reasons. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
